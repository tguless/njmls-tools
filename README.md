# What Is NJMLS Tools?

This is a quick and dirty website developed in 2007

1) Automated ingestion of an NJMLS FTP feed into a MySQL Database (See ftpRefresh.php)
2) A website developed in PHP that allows the user to perform a basic search of real estate properties within an area. 

**DISCLAIMER:** 

This was a quick proto-type. While it can be used as a basis to build upon, it should not be used in a production setting as it has SQL injection vulnerabilities, hard coded paths etc.
